# QA Knowledge Graph API

A FastAPI service is running at http://localhost:8000 connected to a PostgreSQL knowledge graph that maps Jira requirements → Playwright tests → application endpoints.

When the user asks about QA coverage, test impact, dependencies, flaky tests, or searches for requirements/tests, use these endpoints via curl:

## Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /qa/coverage-gaps` | "What requirements have no tests?" / "Show coverage gaps" |
| `GET /qa/impact/{jira_key}` | "What tests cover QA-101?" / "Impact of changing this requirement" |
| `GET /qa/dependencies/{app_key}` | "What depends on the orders app?" / "Show dependencies for app-orders" |
| `GET /qa/flaky-tests` | "Which tests are flaky?" / "Show unreliable tests" |
| `GET /qa/flaky-tests?min_flaky=3` | Filter by minimum flaky count |
| `GET /qa/app-summary` | "Give me an overview of all apps" / "How many tests per app?" |
| `GET /qa/search?q=login` | "Find anything related to login" / "Search for payment" |
| `GET /health` | "Is the knowledge graph running?" |

## Examples

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/qa/coverage-gaps
curl http://localhost:8000/qa/impact/QA-101
curl http://localhost:8000/qa/dependencies/app-orders

curl "http://localhost:8000/qa/search?q=login"
```
